# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a program that searches for vacation destinations based on user inputted maximum and minimum temperatures. This is done by using openweather api and google maps api to find hotels that fall within the temperature threshold. The program then finds four hotels and creates a vacation itinerary based on the chosen locations.
